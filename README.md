# sw3DRenderer
Prototype software 3D renderer written in C, made as a learning exercise.

Inspired by [javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder)'s 3D graphics engine tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU

Uses SDL2 for windowing, input, and event handling.

Build by just running `make`

Controls:

`WASD`: move camera around\
`Mouse`: rotate camera\
`SPACEBAR`: move camera up\
`SHIFT`: move camera down\
`CTRL`: slow movement speed\
`V`: toggle depth buffer view mode\
`ESC`: unfocus window\
`Q`: exit
